    Free software is more than just the bits that you downloaded and installed on your computer. It is a practice, philosophy and community best illustrated by four principles:
  freedom0: The freedom to run the program, for any purpose
  freedom1: The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish
  freedom2: The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor
  freedom3: The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others
